# Car-Sales-Analysis

The Car Sales Dashboard was developed in Power BI to track year-to-date (YTD) and month-to-date (MTD) sales trends, average car prices, and total cars sold across multiple dealerships. Leveraging DAX measures and data modeling, the dashboard provided actionable insights into dealership performance.
